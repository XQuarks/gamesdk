      "message": "Those *should* be separate device ids, but that\u0027s a good thought, it wouldn\u0027t handle a frankendevice properly. I\u0027ve adjusted the logic and streamlined the rescan version to just call onDeviceAdded to reduce duplication. Device disconnection code scans all the internal tables so it isn\u0027t actually a problem for a device id to live in more than one table.\n\nI also added a comment because I realized one thing that isn\u0027t obvious is that some mouse devices also report an additional keyboard (in a different device id), which depending on the device can or can\u0027t be filtered out. Made that a bit clearer.",
