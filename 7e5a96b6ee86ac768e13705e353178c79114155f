      "message": "Can I recommend something?\n\nHave, as a first sentence inside this function, the following:\n\n    static std::mt19937 rng(std::random_device{}());\n\nThus, this function doesn\u0027t need to receive it from its caller (which, in turn, won\u0027t have to capture it in a lambda!). Moreover, this way, this random number generator is just restricted (i.e., encapsulated) where it\u0027s really used; while still being created once, preserved between calls. The caller (function Start()) won\u0027t even know about its existence.\n\nEven better if instead of being named \"rng\", was called \"random_number_generator\" ðŸ‘Œ",
