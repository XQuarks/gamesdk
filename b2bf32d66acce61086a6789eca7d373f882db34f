      "message": "Previously we were passing in the filename as a const char * that we would get from calling .c_str() on a temporary string variable that would be deallocated once it got out of scope and as a result would make the const char * we stored in the Texture instance invalid, and without using a bunch of malloc and strcpy keeping it as a const char * seemed like a messy way to keep the file name around so I changed it to a std::string instead!",
