However, this isn\u0027t rigorous, I don\u0027t know if we can get some sort of singular material layout.\n\nAlso, have raised this to Fran; this line only executes on the first DrawFrame per mesh b/c it only creates a pipeline if one does not already exist. So it\u0027s not really updating if the material descriptor set layout were to change.",
