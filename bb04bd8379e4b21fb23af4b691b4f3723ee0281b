      "message": "This is more of a question, in terms of should we split up the lights ubo and the [eventual] materials sampler? We technically don\u0027t need to, b/c they are different types and wouldn\u0027t be accidentally allocated for one another, but for logical separation maybe it would be good.\n\nOn the other hand, I don\u0027t know if that would mean that we would \"logically\" want more individual descriptor pools with a single type each for new stuff that comes up, so not sure if there\u0027s a better way to determine how we should organize our descriptors.",
