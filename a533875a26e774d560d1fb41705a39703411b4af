      "message": "I\u0027m satisfied this now works -- but I am also thinking about the edge case of the app going to background for some time, then returning. Since watcherStartTime does not change, wouldn\u0027t this cause a big \"budget surplus\" making the runner run almost continuously?\n\nMaybe keeping score since app start is a bit brittle -- include in the accounting only a certain number of seconds in the past instead? I recognize this could be a bit too complex.\n\nAlternatively handle the background-foreground case separately (I feel there could be other similar edge cases though, albeit I can\u0027t come up with another now).",
