      "message": "In consideration of earlier feedback (patch 1), I re-assessed the need to simulate a back button pressing here and concluded that it suffices with enabling host activities to stop data gatherers and stressors once what we needed to check is done.\nFor that reason, I added this stopDataGathererAndStressors() to BaseHostActivity.\n\nThe intention here is clear: five seconds after launching the device camera, this host activity stops all test operations. If a crash happened, it\u0027s already captured and logged (see NougatSigabrtOperation).",
