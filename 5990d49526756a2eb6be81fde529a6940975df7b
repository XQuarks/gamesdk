      "message": "I think the naming of this is now a bit confusing, since the protobuf is not 3.0.0. Perhaps just rename the third_party folder to just protobuf? Also, I see that you modified the source to external/protobuf in the cmake files, where are these binaries coming from? Maybe we should have a script to fetch them instead unless we are building them locally.",

I have plans to remove these binaries completely in the future and have them configured with gradle, but I\u0027ll say let\u0027s keep them for now and I\u0027ll create a bug to remove this dependency in the near future.",
