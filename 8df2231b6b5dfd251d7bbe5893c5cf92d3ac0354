Seems kinda specific and I\u0027m not sure what other usecase we\u0027re supporting where we specifically want just the last frame (for now)?",

Maybe support for nested timing should just come later, but I do think that for a general timing library we should allow for nested cases (what if I want to know what proportion of creating a Mesh is spent on creating descriptors, or something like that?).",
