The vertex data isn\u0027t getting set during initialization here. (It just gets set every time `Step()` is called.) At least, that\u0027s how it appears to me. I think you could just pass in `_vertices.data()` here instead and then delete the code for `MapVerticesBuffer()`, `UnmapVerticesBuffer()`, and `Step()`.",
