      "message": "I was thinking that we should set it to nullptr right after dlclose. It\u0027s not strictly necessary and I would often not bother in a destructor, but there\u0027s quite a bit of logic in the remainder of this destructor and destruction of these kinds of classes is often only tested sporadically.\n\nLeaving it as a dangling pointer in this instance could lead to a situation where a future change introduces a call that depends on the lib in some way and that will be easier to diagnose if mLibAndroid is null, rather than a valid-looking address.\n\nThis is somewhat nitty feedback though, so I\u0027m giving +2 anyway.",
