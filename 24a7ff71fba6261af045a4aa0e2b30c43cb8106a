      "message": "We can, but this would mean that app would need to register with Java Choreographer and pass the callback to us. To avoid this dependency, we are calling internally to onChoreographer() for every swap() if API \u003c 24. ChoreographerFilter will take care of the pacing in this case by using now() and sleep(). It is not as good as Choreographer, but it works.",
