      "message": "AMAZING!!\n\nI tell you an additional idea that you may want to consider.\n\nWe can think about implicit .yamls in the following way:\n\nImagine that this 32bit_depth_clear.yaml file doesn\u0027t exist at all. However, we could launch namely\n\n    $ python run --recipe 32bit_depth_clear.yaml --ftl\n\nfor that non-existent .yaml. The app would realize that the .yaml doesn\u0027t exist but, instead of failing, it would assume an implicit implementation as\n\n    f\"\"\"build:\n      configuration: recipes/configurations/{recipe_path.stem}.json\n    \"\"\"\n\nThis way, for the upcoming tests (Q1, etc.) we wouldn\u0027t have to worry about trivial .yaml files. We would even delete all these existing trivial .yamls.\n\nI mark this suggestion self-resolved so I don\u0027t block the merge of this CL. If you consider this suggestion worth applying but not right now, we can shelve it until the next round of improvements.",
