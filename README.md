# Android Game SDK

## Build the Game SDK

In order to build using prebuild NDK versions, this project must be initialized from a custom repo using:

```bash
mkdir android-games-sdk
cd android-games-sdk
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-games-sdk
# Or for Googlers:
# repo init -u persistent-https://googleplex-android.git.corp.google.com/platform/manifest -b android-games-sdk
repo sync -c -j8
```

### Build with prebuilt SDKs

```bash
cd gamesdk
ANDROID_HOME=../prebuilts/sdk ./gradlew gamesdkZip
```

will build static and dynamic libraries for several SDK/NDK pairs.

### Build with locally installed SDK/NDK

By default, the gradle script builds target `archiveZip`.

```bash
./gradlew archiveZip # Without Tuning Fork
./gradlew archiveTfZip # With Tuning Fork
```

This will use a locally installed SDK/NDK pointed to by `ANDROID_HOME` (and `ANDROID_NDK`, if the ndk isn't in `ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle`).

## Tests

```bash
./gradlew localUnitTests # Requires a connected ARM64 device to run
./gradlew localDeviceInfoUnitTests # No device required, tests are running on host
```

## Samples

Samples are classic Android projects, using CMake to build the native code. They are also all triggering the build of the Game SDK.

### Using Grade command line:

```bash
cd samples/bouncyball && ./gradlew assemble
cd samples/cube && ./gradlew assemble
cd samples/tuningfork/tftestapp && ./gradlew assemble
```

The Android SDK/NDK exposed using environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`) will be used for building both the sample project and the Game SDK.

### Using Android Studio

Open projects using Android Studio:

* `samples/bouncyball`
* `samples/cube`
* `samples/tuningfork/tftestapp`

and run them directly (`Shift + F10` on Linux, `Control + R` on macOS). The local Android SDK/NDK (configured in Android Studio) will be used for building both the sample project and the Game SDK.

#### Development and debugging

After opening a sample project using Android Studio, uncomment the line containing `add_gamesdk_sources()`.
This will add the Swappy/Tuning Fork sources as part of the project. You can then inspect the source code (with working auto completions) and run the app in debug mode (with working breakpoints and inspectors).
