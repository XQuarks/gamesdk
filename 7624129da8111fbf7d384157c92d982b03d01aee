      "message": "Do you think it would be good to have the label of the button show which polyhedron you are currently on? so when you press the button it will change the label to the currently selected polyhedron\u0027s face count \n\nSo the label could be like \"Poly: ##\" where ## is the current face count of the polyhedra\n\nYou might need to add a setter to the button class for the default label in order to do this since I don\u0027t think I have one there\n\n(idea could be applied to texture as well)",

      "message": "Ooh, right now I\u0027m having both buttons change complexity for all the polyhedra (aka all of them will become 12-sided in a step, or all of them will change texture). I figure that that\u0027s probably the most useful for comparing performance? But yeah at least right now, it\u0027s not changing individual objects.",
