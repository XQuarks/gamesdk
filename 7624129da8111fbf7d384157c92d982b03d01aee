      "message": "Do you think it would be good to have the label of the button show which polyhedron you are currently on? so when you press the button it will change the label to the currently selected polyhedron\u0027s face count \n\nSo the label could be like \"Poly: ##\" where ## is the current face count of the polyhedra\n\nYou might need to add a setter to the button class for the default label in order to do this since I don\u0027t think I have one there\n\n(idea could be applied to texture as well)",

      "message": "Ooh, right now I\u0027m having both buttons change complexity for all the polyhedra (aka all of them will become 12-sided in a step, or all of them will change texture). I figure that that\u0027s probably the most useful for comparing performance? But yeah at least right now, it\u0027s not changing individual objects.",

      "message": "I think I\u0027m gonna table this b/c there isn\u0027t a straightforward way to do this that doesn\u0027t also make Button bulkier.\n\nOmar\u0027s suggestion and my thought is that I could add a text setter in Button, and change the std::function signature to include a ptr to the Button that the button could pass with `this`. However, as far as I can tell, there isn\u0027t a way to specify an optional parameter for std::function, which would require that all functions passed to the Button have a Button * param, even if they\u0027re not using it. I don\u0027t think this is a good idea to require, and I don\u0027t think that alternatives are better (in terms of having a std::function with a different signature to assign to, or to wrap all functions without a param with a [] (Button *b) {f();} or something like that).\n\nWe may need some text setting functionality in the future regardless, but I don\u0027t think that expanding it for Poly: ## is worthy for now. An easier alternative would to just print the number of faces per polyhedron, as is done with # of polyhedra and # of triangles, for example.",
