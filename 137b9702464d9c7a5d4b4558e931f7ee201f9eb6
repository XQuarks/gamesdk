      "message": "A bit of a minor thing, but I think the description here should either be removed or should just redundantly restate the purpose. Perhaps more important, I found the function name to be somewhat confusing (what is the result of it scanning?); the \"@return\" documentation was what cleared up my confusion, but I wasn\u0027t able to determine that from the function name alone.",

      "message": "Thanks, @michaelbaxter! I did, both, rename the function and elaborate further on what it means. Please re-review and resolve this feedback if you consider that my latest change closes the gap.\n\nAn observation: by the time you posted this to patch 8, patch 9 had been out already (I\u0027d say for a few hours.) I mean that you weren\u0027t reviewing the latest version, so plusing-1, if had happened, wouldn\u0027t have made effect.",
