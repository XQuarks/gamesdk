      "message": "I am having a difficult time on deciding on the error handling mechanism. I started to implement one approach and then cancelled it:\nI had an enum called \"Status\" with success and all the error cases like:\n- failed to read kernelMax\n- failed to read cpuInfo\n\nI had a repeated error field: an array of all errors encountered. Then I realized they were not very useful as they are already implicit in result, such as:\n- If I fail to get max cpu index, the cpu_cores array is empty.\n- If I fail to read cpuInfo, hardware and cpu_extensions are empty.\n\nIn the end, I postponed the error handling, as right now it is not in a bad state. But I think we should talk about it in detail.",
