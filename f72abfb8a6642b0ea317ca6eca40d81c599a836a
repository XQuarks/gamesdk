      "message": "This system properties API is really yukky. It looks like you could still copy beyond the range of your statically allocated buffer if you call __system_property_get like this. Well, if this source is to be believed: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/7b4d77e/libc/bionic/system_properties.c\nLooking at the header, __system_property_get is now deprecated and you should use __system_property_read_callback instead. This gives you a null-terminated string, by the looks of it, which you can use to initialize your proto strings.",

      "message": "I have done some research to use something other than system properties API. The ones I came across all use system properties API underneath. So I have used __system_property_read_callback whenever available.\n\nThe reason  __system_property_get is deprecated is the 92 char limit, as Idries was worried about:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/yaOW7iG7jOE\n\nI have also looked into parsing the /system/build.prop file directly, but it is missing some properties. Also it advises against parsing it for some attributes.\n\nI think the implementation is in a good state now, unless we find a better alternative to system properties API.",
