      "message": "This system properties API is really yukky. It looks like you could still copy beyond the range of your statically allocated buffer if you call __system_property_get like this. Well, if this source is to be believed: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/7b4d77e/libc/bionic/system_properties.c\nLooking at the header, __system_property_get is now deprecated and you should use __system_property_read_callback instead. This gives you a null-terminated string, by the looks of it, which you can use to initialize your proto strings.",
