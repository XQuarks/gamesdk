test.json configures the number and configuration of the iStresser tests.

It consists of an array of dimensions. Each dimension is itself an array of settings for that
dimension.

They are combined in a cartesian product to product settings for each test, which in turn is run on
every eligible device.

For example, if there were 3 dimensions, containing 2, 3 and 4 settings then 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 tests
would be run in total.

Any configuration key can be set in any dimension. The meaning of each configuration key is set by
the iStresser app. Keys can be overridden in larger-numbered dimensions.
