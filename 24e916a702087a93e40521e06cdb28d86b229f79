I don\u0027t like that I can call SwappyVk_enableBlockingWait(false) and it won\u0027t do anything unless I have already disabled frame pacing.\n\nI don\u0027t have a better API in mind but do we need mBlockingWaitEnabled? It adds even more complexity and another execution path. If it\u0027s very rarely going to be useful I would consider removing it.",
