      "message": "This is a very basic approach to track usage and versioning of TF. \n\n* There is a more sophisticated approach for Swappy in https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/opt/gamesdk/+/947000, so I\u0027ve not added anything for Swappy yet.\n* The approach for Swappy does not export a symbol with the version number, so it\u0027s harder to do analytics. I can work to add a symbol for Swappy with the version number later once the changes are merged?\n* I can also rework this to add in another CL (or in this CL as you prefer) a similar check for .so/.h mismatch (although I\u0027m not sure if the .so will be used at all according to Idries comment?) and a single #define with the version number (but I wanted to start simple :))",
