      "message": "Great question, Shamyl.\n\nI\u0027ll try to reconfirm what I\u0027m gonna tell and, if proved to be unneeded, will remove the call to onBackPressed().\n\nWhat I perceived happening on my manual tests (i.e., a physical Nougat device plugged to my gMac) was that the keystroke was dispatched 5 seconds after launching the camera, as expected, but processed several seconds later -a few minutes later, I should say-\nPossibly the unresponsiveness reason is the fact that the poor device is intentionally memory-constrained. The deal with that is that as onBackPressed() was slow to get called, the test kept allocating memory, issuing onMemoryTrim and degrading things further.\n\nI ensured that onBackPressed() got called even if the keystroke wasn\u0027t yet processed so BaseHostActivity stopped all running operations -this provided that if by this time, 5 seconds after, I was still alive it was because the crash didn\u0027t happen and it was safe to end the test-.\n\nAll this said, let me retry that this extra-measure is really needed. In the worst case, that we still need it, I\u0027d like to expose a NougatHostActivity function \"stop-all-operations\" (that internally calls onBackPressed) so it\u0027s clear, from the perspective of this test, what the real intention is. I disliked this code I wrote myself not that I re-read it.",

      "message": "Hi Michael, could be debatable. While it\u0027s true that so far was just a list holder, it\u0027s still a Python __init__.py file. These files are meant to hold things we want available module-wise.\n\nBecause so far we didn\u0027t have anything else than the list of handlers, that was the only thing that this __init__.py was for. But looks like this time around I got something more meaningful for this module __init__ to be good at :-)\n\nI\u0027d personally keep it as is and we wouldn\u0027t be violating any Python rule for module __init__ files. But I\u0027d change my mind if it started growing way too big. Then, splitting would be certainly a recommended action.\n\nI hope it makes sense!",
