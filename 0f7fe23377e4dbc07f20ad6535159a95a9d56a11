      "message": "So device_info is using nano for size reasons but the test app (or anything that reads the serialized proto returned by device_info) can indeed be using any flavour of pb - lite right now.\nWhile there seems to be a java nano version of pb, I think it\u0027s fine to keep using the lite version for the test app as it seems a bit more convenient to use (and we verify that the serialized proto is readable by another library)",
