      "message": "Currently we have one SwappyVkBase instance per device, with multiple swap chains possible on that device, and we could do this without storing the perDeviceImplementation map but I think it makes it easier to keep it.\n\nOr should we be having one SwappyVkBase instance per swapchain? Can we have different timings on different windows?\n\nI also noticed that in SwappyVk::QueuePresent we only look at the first swapchain in the VkPresentInfoKHR::pSwapchains array. I guess having one queue present to multiple swapchains here is very niche (window mirroring?), but do we need to present to them all?",
