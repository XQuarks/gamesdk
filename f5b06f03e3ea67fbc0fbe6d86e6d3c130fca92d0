To me it seems like lazy initialization in `SetEnabled` seems correct, instead I think we should check if it is initialized/enabled in the callers that do `UpdateOomScore` \u0026 `UpdateMemInfo`. Otherwise we would be doing unnecessary tracking when the default memoryinfo provider is never enabled.",
