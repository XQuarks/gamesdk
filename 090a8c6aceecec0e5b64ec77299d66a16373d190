      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure they should be constants - it depends on how large our scene ends up being spatially and might be something we want to change depending on the type of scene we are presenting (like if there\u0027s stuff way out in the distance or if stuff will mostly be close to the camera\n\nThese essentially set how deep the frustum goes (and as a result how far/nearby something can be in order to be rendered)",
