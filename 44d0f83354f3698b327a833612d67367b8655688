      "message": "I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a way to avoid having all this computation w/ inputData? I think in updateCamera it\u0027s pretty fine b/c you\u0027re just checking for the conditions doubleTapHoldUpper and doubleTapHoldLower, but having this more fine-grained logic in here to determine where the singleTap is less readable and messier (maybe something with like isLower[Left/Right]SingleTap()?)",

      "message": "Yea this makes sense, since I already abstract the screen resolution computations for working with double taps, it would make the code more consistent if I did the same for single taps\n\nAlthough I\u0027m actually still wondering about refactoring the input code later to be just flags where like you can ask questions like\n\nif (doubleTap \u0026\u0026 lowerHalf \u0026\u0026 leftSide)\nrather then having specific flags like lowerLeftSingleTap since that could get messy",
