I think in updateCamera it\u0027s pretty fine b/c you\u0027re just checking for the conditions doubleTapHoldUpper and doubleTapHoldLower, but having this more fine-grained logic in here to determine where the singleTap is less readable and messier (maybe something with like isLower[Left/Right]SingleTap()?)",
